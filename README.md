## üì¨ API Usage

### Send a Notification

- Endpoint: `POST /notifications`
- Body fields:
  - `userId` (string, required)
  - `type` (string: `email`, `sms`, or `in-app`, required)
  - `message` (string, required)
  - `email` (string, required for email type)
  - `phone` (string, required for sms type)

### Get All Notifications for a User

- Endpoint: `GET /users/:id/notifications`

---

## üì¶ Example Requests

Send an email notification:
POST /notifications
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "123",
  "type": "email",
  "message": "Hello via Email!",
  "email": "test@example.com"
}

Send an SMS notification:
POST /notifications
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "123",
  "type": "sms",
  "message": "Hello via SMS!",
  "phone": "+911234567890"
}

Send an in-app notification:
POST /notifications
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "123",
  "type": "in-app",
  "message": "Hello in-app!"
}

Get all notifications for a user:
GET /users/123/notifications

---

## üìù Assumptions & Notes

- SMS notifications are simulated (not sent to real phones).
- Email notifications use Ethereal, a test SMTP service; preview links are shown in the server logs.
- In-app notifications are stored in memory; all notifications are lost if the server restarts.
- Queue and retry logic ensure reliable delivery (up to 3 attempts).
- No sensitive data is hardcoded.

---

## üöß Future Improvements

- Integrate real SMS/email providers (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid)
- Use a persistent database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for notifications
- Add user preferences and notification scheduling
- Implement a production-grade queue (RabbitMQ, Redis, etc.)
- Add authentication and rate limiting
